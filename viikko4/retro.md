## Retrospective

In software development and other group projects it is usually good idea to reflect on what has been done at the end of the project or iteration. These meetings are called retros (retrospective meeting or so) and they are
good way to for members of the project to think what was done right, what went wrong and to identify areas what could be improved. It's very handy especially in continous software development projects, but it is also suited
for one-time projects since it can be beneficial for future projects.

https://retrospectivewiki.org/index.php?title=Retrospective_Plans contains multiple different restrospective plans, but I think the most common one is "Start, Stop, Continue, More of, Less of Wheel" plan, or at least that is
what I have found myself most often doing.

Our Retros usually have a have third person as so called retro-master, who has not been part of the sprint or project during the iteration. As the title suggested first we have some time to write up on post-it note what we
should start doing. Then we are given some time to think and similarly write up what we should stop doing. Usually this means we think what we have done wrong during the last sprint and if we know what led to it we usually
select it as a thing we should stop doing (real life example from our last retro: no more friday releases to prd). Continue and more of in our retro is more or less the same thing. We have implemented something last spring and deemed
it works for the future iterations of the project (e.g. req. security updates must be pushed to prod 7 days before the actual deadline).
